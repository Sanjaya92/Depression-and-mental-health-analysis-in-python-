# Depression and Mental Health Analysis
### Overview
This project explores the relationships between various demographic factors and mental health indicators. The dataset used for this analysis contains information on factors such as age, gender, occupation, and indoor activities, along with measures of mental health including growing stress, quarantine frustrations, changes in habits, etc.

### Data Source
The dataset used for this analysis can be found at [link to dataset](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/pxjmjyfdh2/2). It is titled "The RHMCD-20 datasets for Depression and Mental Health Data Analysis with Machine Learning" and was created by Salehin, Imrus; Amin, Nazrul.

### Repository Contents:
- Jupyter Notebook: Contains the Python code for the analysis.
- README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.

  ### Usage
To replicate the analysis:

1) Download the dataset from the provided link.
2) Open the Jupyter Notebook file in your preferred environment.
3) Run the code cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.

## Analysis:
- ### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Utilized various EDA techniques such as info(), describe(), value_counts(), and unique() to understand the structure and characteristics of the dataset.
- ### Relationship Analysis:

Explored relationships between demographic factors (age, gender, occupation) and mental health indicators (e.g., growing stress, mood swings, coping struggles) using visualizations such as bar charts, box plots, and chi-squared tests.

## Conclusion:
This analysis provides insights into how demographic factors may be related to mental health indicators. Further analysis and modeling could help in understanding and addressing mental health challenges more effectively.
